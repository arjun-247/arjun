            <h1>FLOWER</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="row text-center fs-5 m-2">A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure
            found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in
            flowering plants consist of a few haploid cells which produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte, which
            produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within
            the ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination.
            Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from the same flower or a different flower of
            the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when
            pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different
            individual of the same species.

            Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned
            so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the
            plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.

            Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the
            site where gametophytes develop.

            Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen
            between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including
            brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for
            pollinators. In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent
            on services they provide to one anotherâ€”in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's
            case, a source of food.[3] After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing
            seeds.

            Flowers have long been appreciated by humans for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold cultural
            significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of medicine and food. </div>
